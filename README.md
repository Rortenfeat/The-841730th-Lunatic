# The 841730th Lunatic（Demo）

`main.pd` is the original patch I'd been making in Pure Data Vanilla.

For a better performance while recording the video, I moved it into Purr Data, compacted the objects and added record function, that's `main-compact.pd`.

"841730" has no special meaning except it was the seed number for random functions in the video.
